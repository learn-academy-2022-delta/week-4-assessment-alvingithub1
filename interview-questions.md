# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props in React are used in child componenets to help with rendering the state back up to the parent class to make the changes instantly without having to refresh the webpage.

  Researched answer: Props is a special keyword which stands for properties. Props is used for passing data from one component to another. Also, props cannot be changed and it is strictly only used for passing data and not changing that data. 
  
  An example of props is a parent class calling the child class in the render/return. In the child class, it would put in the return as {this.props.object}. The parent class would call the child class like this example: <ChildClass object={"Text example"}>. This is how the child/parent relationship can be useful to call props.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM is a document object model. The DOM is used when an update is being made on a webpage and it needs to refresh itself for the changes to appear.

  Researched answer: A DOM event is when there is something on the browser that is occurring or triggered. This can happen by either the user or the browser. DOM events allow JavaScript to use different event handlers on elements of an HTML page. Examples of a DOM event can be when an object is clicked, a text field is changed, or the mouse hovers over an object.




3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming focuses on everything being an object rather than focusing on the functionality of the program. OOP style programming also focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.


  Researched answer: OOP focuses on data or objects rather than functions and logic. An object is something that has unique attributes and behavior. This style of programming is best use for large-scale codebase and software with multiple people and teams on one single project. OOP has four main principles: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. OOP is different than functional programming, because functional programming focuses on functions and OOP focuses on classes and objects.




4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float is a number with decimals. An integer is a whole number.

  Researched answer: A float is a number that contains a decimal point. Integers are whole numbers that are positive, negative, or zero. Ruby considers whole numbers as an integer. In order for an integer to be considered a float, it will need a decimal point with a number at the end.




5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: An implicit return in Ruby means that a return statement is not required to put and will always return an output.

  Researched answer: Implicit return means that the return isn’t called within a method in Ruby and it returns the value of the last execution in the method.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: An instance variable in Ruby is initialized with an @ symbol and the name of the variable. Methods have their own scope and instance variables are tied to those methods. This is a part of OOP and encapsulation. Instance variables can’t be read outside of that scope.

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a relational database management system. PostgreSQL is open source and supports both SQL and JSON querying.

3. Ruby on Rails: Rails is a full-stack framework that goes with Ruby. Ruby on Rails combines Ruby with JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create web applications.

4. ORM: ORM stands for object-relational mapping. It is an object-oriented layer between the OOP language and the database that removes a lot of additional code that is not needed.

5. Active Record: The Active Record is the ORM layer in Rails. The Active Records have CRUD commands (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) methods for the database.
